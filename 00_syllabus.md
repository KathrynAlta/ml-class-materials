#### Where is it pitched?
Our aim is to understand the concepts, theory, and algorithms behind the main categories of machine learning algorithms and in particular be able to place any machine learning tool, typically a collection of algorithms, within a wider data-science context and to identify strengths and weaknesses in its application and when, where, and how to use it appropriately. A further goal is to be able to combine fundamental algorithms to make your own tools for specific applications. I'll try to develop an intuitive understanding of the foundational algorithms and concepts mostly through coding with example datasets plus a bit of basic math. You'll code and apply these algorithms to your own datasets. From this foundation you should be able to go deeper through self study.

#### Prerequisites
I'll demonstrate using R and Python. This is not a beginners class in either R, Python or data science! Ideally you will have taken Part 1 of my EBIO5460 sequence (Part 1: Fundamentals of Data Science for Ecology and Evolution). If you haven't taken that class it is possible to take the present class but a little catch up will be necessary. I strongly suggest you at least have taken some sort of statistics or computation class at an intermediate level. You must already be proficient with R or Python (you don't need both), preferably with experience with your own data. Alternatively, if you are proficient in another language, then you should be fine (I'll largely use fundamental coding techniques that are similar in most languages). Proficiency with GitHub is presumed but I'll provide materials to quickly get up to speed if you're not already (don't worry, you'll only need some basic skills). Please see me to discuss any prerequisite areas you think you might need guidance about.

#### The ultimate learning goals
* You will have an understanding of the fundamental concepts and algorithms that underpin most of machine learning
* You will be confident to use machine learning algorithms in your own research
* You will have a broad overview of how machine learning algorithms are currently being used in ecology and evolution to revolutionize research

#### Learning format
I'm envisioning a collaborative learning atmosphere. Machine learning is a rapidly advancing field and many new techniques have not yet been applied or are only starting to be applied in ecology and evolution. We'll explore these cutting-edge areas. For the first half, I'll lecture on fundamental concepts and you'll have weekly reading and practical coding assignments. Collaboration is encouraged both in and out of class. Next, in a student-driven discussion and presentation format, we'll explore the recent literature in ecology and evolution to consider where machine learning is having a revolutionizing impact on research. In an individual project you'll apply algorithms to your own data, which ideally will help you address your thesis research. Alternatively you can choose to do a literature review.

I hope that we can create an environment that is relaxed and nonjudgmental so that we'll all feel comfortable participating and also that all contributions are valued. I also hope that we can create an environment of respect for each other's learning processes and ideas.

#### Computing
You'll need access to computing. If you have a reasonably modern laptop, that's perfect. If you don't have access to computing please let me know as soon as possible. I can provide access to some great alternative compute resources. We'll also learn about and use the University of Colorado supercomputing resources.

#### Coding environment
Please upgrade to the latest version of R or Python. I'll use Positron as my integrated development environment (IDE) because it is great for switching between R and Python and is being developed as the replacement to RStudio. You are welcome to use whatever IDE you prefer. I'm assuming you use these tools regularly and are proficient at upgrading already.

#### Texts
We'll sample from several texts and papers. Most of it is available free to you. If there is any material that can't be posted publicly, I'll post it to the class Google Drive folder.

The main text book for the first eight weeks of the semester is:

* James G, Witten D, Hastie T, Tibshirani R (2021). An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R (or Python), Second edition. Springer, New York.
* [Book website](https://www.statlearning.com/): free download

For using keras to model neural networks, I am using:

* Chollet F, Kalinowski T, Allaire JJ (2022). Deep Learning with R, Second edition. Manning Publications Co, Shelter Island, NY.
* [Website](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition) and [code](https://github.com/t-kalinowski/deep-learning-with-R-2nd-edition-code/tree/main)
* Chollet F (2021). Deep Learning with Python, Second edition. Manning Publications Co. LLC, New York.

Other more advanced texts that I am referencing include:

* Hastie T, Tibshirani R, Friedman JH (2009). The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, 2nd ed. Springer, New York, NY.
* Bishop CM, Bishop H (2024). Deep Learning: Foundations and Concepts. Springer, Cham.
* Goodfellow I, Bengio Y, Courville A (2016). Deep Learning. The MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

A text heavily influencing the way I think about the broader topic of data science from an interdisciplinary perspective is:

* Efron B & Hastie T (2016). Computer Age Statistical Inference: Algorithms, Evidence, and Data Science. Cambridge.
* This text is aimed at masters or first-year PhD students in statistics and data science. After completing this course (and the complementary semester in Part 1), you might find this a useful book with a friendly level of math.

Ebook versions of most Springer texts are available for free through the university library. Paperback versions of just about any Springer text can be purchased by University of Colorado students for $25 each. To purchase, do a Chinook search via the CU library (you must be on the campus network or via VPN, not the guest wifi), follow the link to the ebook version, and look for the Springer offer to buy the paperback version. Be aware however that these versions are not in color, which is certainly an issue for interpreting plots!

* https://github.com/EBIO5460Spring2026

All of your work will be tracked and submitted here (via a Git commit and push).

#### Your fieldwork
I realize that as graduate students you may have fieldwork or other research to complete during the semester. Please see me early on so we can talk about how we can work around your fieldwork.

#### My commitments
I need to travel for fieldwork in the first few weeks. Mostly I'll be able to give the class via Zoom at the usual time. Sometimes I'll be unable to attend the scheduled class time and I'll provide pre-recorded materials for these classes and opportunity for follow up questions.

#### Classroom behavior

Students and faculty are responsible for maintaining an appropriate learning environment in all instructional settings, whether in person, remote, or online. Failure to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, marital status, political affiliation, or political philosophy. For more information, see the [classroom behavior policy](https://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior), the [Student Code of Conduct](https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/media/230), and the [Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance](https://www.colorado.edu/oiec/).


#### Accommodation for disabilities, temporary medical conditions, and medical isolation

If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit your accommodation letter from Disability Services to your faculty member in a timely manner so that your needs can be addressed.  Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities in the academic environment.
